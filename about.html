<p>The coupe can easily be recognized thanks to its exclusive 2-door design. Most coupes have a sporty design to emphasize its style. The coupe is ideal for single adults or a couple who doesnâ€™t have any children. This is because the rear seats are quite difficult to access since you have to use the two full-size passenger doors. Most coupes have a hatchback rear instead of a separate trunk to make it easy to load large items. In addition, most coupes have a fixed roof while some have a targa top, which is a semi-fixed roof. </p>
